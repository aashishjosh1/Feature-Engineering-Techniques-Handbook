# Feature-Engineering-Techniques-Handbook
## Introduction
Feature engineering is performed for improving accuracy and training speed of the model in machine learning applications. It is a process of selecting and transforming attributes and is performed as part of data pre-processing in order to make it easier for the ML algorithm to interpret the input data. Most commonly used feature engineering techniques include one-hot encoding, binning, normalization, data imputation and standardization
